# 🌐 Travel Management Project
Full Stack Development

This is a basic web-based **Travel Management System** built using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. It allows users to explore destinations, search for trips, and register or update their travel details through an engaging and user-friendly interface.

## 🧭 Overview

The Travel Management project is designed to simulate a simple travel booking experience with features like:

- A responsive homepage with travel inspiration
- Destination search with date selection
- Activity highlights (e.g., camping, trekking, paragliding)
- Image gallery showcasing various travel spots
- User signup and information update forms
- Contact form with PHP backend handling

---

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project

1. Install XAMPP or any local server that supports PHP.
2. Place all project files into the `htdocs` directory.
3. Start Apache and MySQL via the XAMPP control panel.
4. Create a database named `travel` and a table `contactus` with appropriate fields.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost/main.html`.

## 🔒 Note on Backend

- The PHP scripts assume a MySQL server running on `localhost:3308`.
- Update database credentials in `signup.php`, `update.php`, and `contactus.php` as needed.
- Make sure form fields and database columns match for smooth data handling.

## 📌 Future Scope

- Add user authentication and login sessions
- Store and display travel bookings dynamically
